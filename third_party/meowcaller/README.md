[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/purpshell/meowcaller.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/purpshell/meowcaller)

meowcaller is a Go library for the WhatsApp Web VoIP stack. It is 100% pure GO without CGO and it has minimal dependencies. It includes the novel proprietary audio codec MLOW written and validated completely in GO. In turn, meowcaller does not rely on any native bindings and can run everywhere that GO can.

## Discussion
Matrix room: [#meowcaller:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#meowcaller:matrix.org).

Discord channel: #meowcaller in the [WhiskeySockets Discord server](https://whiskey.so/discord).

You can find the underlying spec in the [WhatsApp Calls Research Group](https://wacrg.org). Video transition behavior is cross-checked against the independently implemented [whatsapp-rust call stack](https://github.com/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust/pull/1024).

## Usage
The [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/purpshell/meowcaller) includes docs for all methods.

There's a range of examples in the [examples](/examples/) directory.

The API is easy to approach and implement: attach a **`Source`** to send media, a **`Sink`** to receive it, and register callbacks for call events.

A 12-line example to show the power and simplicity of the library:
```go
// wa is a whatsmeow.Client
client := meowcaller.NewClient(wa)

client.OnIncomingCall(func(call *meowcaller.Call) {
    call.Answer()

    if mp3, err := meowcaller.MP3File("hello.mp3"); err == nil {
        call.Play(mp3)               // stream audio to the caller
    }
    if wav, err := meowcaller.WAVRecorder("caller.wav"); err == nil {
        call.Receive(wav)            // record their voice
    }
    if h264, err := meowcaller.AnnexBRecorder("caller.h264"); err == nil {
        call.ReceiveVideo(h264)      // record their video
    }
})

// Placing a call is just as short:
call, _ := client.Call(ctx, "+15551234567")
call.Receive(meowcaller.SinkFunc(func(pcm []float32) { /* the peer's audio */ }))
```

## Features

Core VoIP features are present:

- Outbound calls
- Inbound calls
- Audio calls (the pure-Go MLow codec)
- Video calls, including calls that start with video
- Mid-call audio-to-video upgrade, acceptance, rejection, cancellation, and downgrade
- Camera orientation and authenticated video keyframe feedback
- Send and receive call emoji reactions over the dedicated RTC app-data stream
- Experimental ad-hoc and group-bound group calls, including add/ring participant
- Experimental reusable call links and approval waiting rooms
- Experimental participant video/reactions, arbitrary emoji, hand state, and screen-share state

The experimental group surface uses the latest upstream `go.mau.fi/whatsmeow`;
it does not require a fork. See the
[group-call feature guide](docs/whatsapp-group-call-features.md) and the
`examples/web` browser test console.

Things that are not yet implemented:

- Opus codec fallback for clients not using MLOW (in progress; testing edge cases)
- Scheduled-call event messages (the call link itself is supported)

## Credits

meowcaller relies heavily on primitives that are implemented in the [WhatsApp Calls Research Group](https://wacrg.org). I thank all the developers who have contributed to it.

The video transition lifecycle was validated against [whatsapp-rust PR #1024](https://github.com/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust/pull/1024), an independent implementation of the same protocol.
